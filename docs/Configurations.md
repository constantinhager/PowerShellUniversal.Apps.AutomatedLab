# Adding New Lab Configurations

The `New Lab` feature provides a forms-based approach to bringing a new lab configuration under management.

## Usage

1. Open the `New Lab` page
2. Provide a Name for your new configuration
3. Provide the path to a `.ps1` script either on disk, or as a Url
4. Add any additional parameters that the definition requires. _Currently only supports string data_
5. Click `Create Lab Configuration`.
